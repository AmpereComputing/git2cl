git2cl
======

This is a quick'n'dirty tool to convert git logs to GNU ChangeLog
format.

The tool expects output from 'git --pretty --numstat --summary' on
stdin.  Thus, typically you would use it as follows:

...........................................................................
jas@mocca:~/src/libtasn1$ git log --pretty --numstat --summary | ~/src/git2cl/git2cl > ChangeLog
jas@mocca:~/src/libtasn1$
...........................................................................

The output format is specified by:

In the future, git2cl may be modified to run this command itself,
similar to how cvs2cl works.

My inspiration for writing this tool was the
link:http://www.red-bean.com/cvs2cl/[cvs2cl] tool, which I am using in
several projects.  Replacing it is a necessary condition for me to
seriously consider switching from CVS to GIT for my projects.

Currently, git2cl lacks much of the flexibility in git2cl.  Sheesh,
git2cl doesn't even have command line parameters!
